PROBLEM :
explosion texture was unscaled and one time out of two was uncentered and unscaled
FIX:
overwrite drawSprite and switch height and width with a personal integer 
that reflects the hight/width of the explosion size AND texture size


PROBLEM :
tooltip keeps adding item info to the tooltip,
giving never ending same tips
FIX : 
re-instantiate the list when calling the getInfo() method
