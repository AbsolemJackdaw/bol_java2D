kao nemesis wanted to imply invisible blocks. a prototype for the invisible blocks type is already set in the Tile class

make a configuration menu option to change drawing distance
 > thought : get screen size, divide by tile size, draw x + 2 tiles
 
 and i found a way for the invisible goggles btw !
if you equip the helmet, it will reload the map and every ghost block will turn un-ghost
thats how i'll solve it i think
