kao nemesis wanted to imply invisible blocks. a prototype for the invisible blocks type is already set in the Tile class

 and i found a way for the invisible goggles btw !
if you equip the helmet, it will reload the map and every ghost block will turn un-ghost
thats how i'll solve it i think

turn tile file into a folder with solid and ghost individual textures and load them from there !
this would allow for infinite textures and you can still set an id for each block. the id could become a string, the name of the .png file !

every level has a goal : x resources, or x this or x that to pass on to the next level

tuto levels : 
tuto 1 : move, jump, swim;
tuto 2 : hit, collect resources, kill
tuto 3 : make a crafting table, place it down (use hotbar nr to interact), craft a sword 

for tutos, and other ? make a Sign block, which shows some info when collided ! :)
