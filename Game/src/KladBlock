XboxController detection when connected ? 
 > solution, add a controls menu option to modify controls and switch to/from keyboard to controller
     reload controller when chosen.
          
kao nemesis wanted to imply invisible blocks. a prototype for the invisible blocks type is already set in the Tile class

 and i found a way for the invisible goggles btw !
if you equip the helmet, it will reload the map and every ghost block will turn un-ghost
thats how i'll solve it i think

every level has a goal : x resources, or x this or x that to pass on to the next level

recipes to do

bombs : pouch, gunpowder, modifiers : more gunpower, more power ?

make a TooltipComponent which stores sizes, text, and font. draw the component instead of just some text
